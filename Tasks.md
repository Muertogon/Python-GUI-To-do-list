1. Widgets to create:
    combo box   - to choose the importance of the task
    input field - to write, what whould be the task called
    button      - to add a new task to the task list 
2. Task list
    should be on another window




# Frame on the right should show the tasks and delete at the end of each of them

# dynamically add task in the next window, aka add the widget, when adding a task, the tasks.json file should be appended with a new entry

# put all methods and logic in seperate files, after completing the task




Done

## Frame on the left should be the place where I put the info about the task, the priority and add button or reset button, to reset all the info

## make the add button disabled if the entry box is empty

## pop up an info message that if the text is too long or too short, should fix it
